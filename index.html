        My name is Jean-Baptiste JASSOGNE, I am 19 years old. I currently live in Le Perreux-Sur-Marne in the Paris suburbs. I spent 11 years of schooling at Le Perreux and then went to boarding school for 4 years at the Saint-Joseph de Reims school. So I went from a classic school to a collective way of life, which was completely different. I have always been immersed in the world of entrepreneurship since I was a child, my father having created his first business at the age of 23. Wishing to become an entrepreneur myself, I decided to follow an economic course by integrating the economic and social sector, specialising in mathematics. After my A levels in economics, curious and eager to work on my English, I went to Brighton in the UK for 6 months, in a host family and language school. Today, I'm at the I√âSEG School of Management in my first year. My main values are ambition, personal development and the discovery of new people, new cultures.

      <h2>üìã Formation</h2> 
      <p>
        I'm at the I√âSEG School of Management in my first year. I first want to integrate a business school to acquire some theoretical and technical fundamentals. After that, I want to go abroad to develop specific competences in finance, human resources and marketing. I will base my internships research on that. Finally, my professional project is to create my own company.

        From September 2019 to February 2020, I have been lucky enough to go to Brighton, next to London. My full immersion in Brighton allowed me to improve with my English and to discover some Anglo-Saxon cultures. It‚Äôs one of my most unforgettable piece of memory. I have always got inspiration from MONTAIGNE said- ‚ÄúTravel broadens the mind‚Äù. In other words, when you travel, you are more open minded and you feel very small. It makes you feel humble. So, I learnt to step back and reflect to develop my curiosity.

        I gratuated from the Saint-Joseph de Reims school. In particular, I participated in a team project which consisted in building a merry-go-round for the primary school of my school group, a project which lasted 3 years. This project allowed me to develop values of solidarity, sharing and commitment.

      <p>
      I listen to a lot of music üéß In my opinion, listening to music allows several things ‚Äì in a group, it can create new friendships which seem impossible at first sight. When I listen to music on my own, it becomes a source of inner peace and well-being. I feel more relax. My passion is American movies, especially thriller action movies üé•
      I love two producers who are Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. Nolan has made a lot of complexes movies. And, when I am watching a movie, I appreciate a plot to be complex.
